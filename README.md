******To JS Beginners****It's a Simple Example to Get on Boarded.
This is an Object-Oriented js game! 
Three major objects: view, model, and controller.
Right, it's called Diamond Trip:
Your role is to fire three dimonds in the grid to win! But they are now hidden inside.

For example, enter E2 in the input box, and hit "fire" button.
You will get a message of each shoot. The grid will turn to green/yellow to indicate the result.
The game is redesigned from the original one called battleship. But it now looks quite different.

******To MYSELF***It's a Nightmare***I Publish It to Help Me Remember a Lesson!
Because of my low efficiency of working on it, the progress was delayed a few hours. I didn't stop, I struggled for a while, tired and sleepy. I knew I was approaching, however, I didn't finish it until it's too late. I would have a significantly important event in the next morning...

The result was that I missed that event, which I think is the most regretful thing in my life! I repent deeply, but it's too late. I hate myself so much! I just hate... Seems like I'm not serious to the thing I was supposed to be serious of. I should not persist on the thing that I should not persist. It's everything about reputation, honor, trust, etc. I hope time could travel back and then I can change everything from that point. I just hope, regret, and go on... I'm gonna get a tattoo to help me remember it as well.
