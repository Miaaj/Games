This is an Object-Oriented JS Game! 
It's called Diamond Trip:
Your role is to fire three dimonds in the grid to win!

For example, enter E2 in the input box, and hit "fire" button.

You will get a message of each shoot. The grid will turn to green/yellow to indicate the result.

The game is redesigned from the original one called battleship. But it now looks quite different.
